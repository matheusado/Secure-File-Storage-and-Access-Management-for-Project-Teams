# Secure-File-Storage-and-Access-Management-for-Project-Teams
Secure Access &amp; Auditing: Built a Linux-based secure file storage solution enforcing Least Privilege and Traceable Access for project teams. Implemented POSIX ACLs and the sticky bit for file segregation. Utilized auditd for all file activity logging, exporting logs to an Apache dashboard secured with Basic Auth for IT review.
